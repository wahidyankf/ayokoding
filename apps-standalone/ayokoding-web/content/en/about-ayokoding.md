In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

Welcome to AyoKoding! I'm Yoka, the passionate software engineer and creator of this platform. AyoKoding was born from "learning in public," emphasizing the importance of sharing knowledge, ideas, and experiences with the world as we continuously learn and grow. By doing so, we can receive others' feedback, support, and constructive criticism, propelling our improvement and development as software engineers.

At AyoKoding, I strive to share my learning journey and create a space where we can all contribute valuable insights, ultimately benefiting from one another's knowledge and experiences to become better software engineers. My dedication to giving back to the community has driven me to provide helpful information on various topics related to software engineering.

Explore a range of topics on AyoKoding, from the life of a programmer and software engineering principles to working in tech companies and tips for enhancing your software engineering skills. I hope that my content inspires and offers valuable insights to our readers.
