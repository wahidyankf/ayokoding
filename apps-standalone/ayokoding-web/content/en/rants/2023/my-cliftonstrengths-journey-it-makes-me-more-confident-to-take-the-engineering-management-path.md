# My CliftonStrengths Journey: It makes me more confident to take the engineering management path

بِسْــــــــــــــــــمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيْمِ

In the name of Allah, The Most Gracious and The Most Merciful

April 24, 2023

About a month ago, I took the [CliftonStrengths](../../../learn/human/tools/cliftonstrengths/) assessment, an experience that led me on a path of self-discovery and validation. My boss, Ariya Hidayat, recommended the test to me and other engineering managers at our company. Initially, I was skeptical about its effectiveness and how much it would help me grow in my career. However, I remembered that Ariya had also recommended it to other managers, so I took a leap of faith and completed the assessment.

When I received the results, I discovered that my top 5 strengths were [Achiever](../../../learn/human/tools/cliftonstrengths/themes/executing/achiever/), [Connectedness](../../../learn/human/tools/cliftonstrengths/themes/relationship-building/connectedness/), [Relator](../../../learn/human/tools/cliftonstrengths/themes/relationship-building/relator/), [Learner](../../../learn/human/tools/cliftonstrengths/themes/strategic-thinking/learner/), [Responsibility](../../../learn/human/tools/cliftonstrengths/themes/executing/responsibility/). At first glance, I was surprised by how accurate these findings seemed. As I began reflecting on my past experiences and approach to work, I realized these strengths resonated with me and shed light on some of my most defining traits.
For instance, I've always had a workaholic attitude and a solid drive to progress in my career and personal goals, even during my vacations. This aligns perfectly with the Achiever's strength. Another example is my deep-rooted disdain for those who lack integrity at work, which corresponds with Responsibility strength.

Furthermore, I've always valued my one-on-one sessions with team members, rarely skipping them throughout my career as a lead or engineering manager. This can be attributed to my Relator strength. Additionally, I've consistently sought out companies that I believe have a significant social impact or cause, demonstrating my Connectedness strength.
Finally, a colleague once told me, "I think learning is your hobby." This statement reflects my Learner strength and the constant pursuit of knowledge and self-improvement.

Not only has the CliftonStrengths assessment helped me understand my innate tendencies and behaviors, but it has also provided me with a sense of validation. Embracing my unique strengths has empowered me to become a more effective leader and foster an environment where my team and I can thrive. I now feel confident that choosing a career as a software engineering manager was the right path for me.

In conclusion, my initial skepticism about the CliftonStrengths assessment has transformed into gratitude and self-awareness. I can now better leverage my strengths, which have positively impacted my career and personal growth. I recommend this assessment to anyone looking for deeper insight into their strengths and how they can use them to achieve success in their chosen field.
