# My CliftonStrengths Journey: It makes me more confident to take the engineering management path

بِسْــــــــــــــــــمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيْمِ

In the name of Allah, The Most Gracious and The Most Merciful

April 24, 2023

About a month ago, I took the [CliftonStrengths](../../Learn%2003d2ad3fc6464b7e9daa164af77e7688/Human%2004c79c94438c46a99ae6f6fa1ec90829/Tools%205f0f404d05e94839b61e75e53d392983/CliftonStrengths%2025f5a900977a48ffa837ad3fa1238340.md) assessment, an experience that led me on a path of self-discovery and validation. My boss, Ariya Hidayat, recommended the test to me and other engineering managers at our company. Initially, I was skeptical about its effectiveness and how much it would help me grow in my career. However, I remembered that Ariya had also recommended it to other managers, so I took a leap of faith and completed the assessment.

When I received the results, I discovered that my top 5 strengths were [Achiever](../../Learn%2003d2ad3fc6464b7e9daa164af77e7688/Human%2004c79c94438c46a99ae6f6fa1ec90829/Tools%205f0f404d05e94839b61e75e53d392983/CliftonStrengths%2025f5a900977a48ffa837ad3fa1238340/Themes%209c16e613023743ae9f91a5ec8165a876/Executing%20001f4521e469482d8ee98715cec37a5e/Achiever%203251924829a3464593e0a865ab1825a5.md), [Connectedness](../../Learn%2003d2ad3fc6464b7e9daa164af77e7688/Human%2004c79c94438c46a99ae6f6fa1ec90829/Tools%205f0f404d05e94839b61e75e53d392983/CliftonStrengths%2025f5a900977a48ffa837ad3fa1238340/Themes%209c16e613023743ae9f91a5ec8165a876/Relationship%20Building%200ed193b271f946ef92bc13c3ee390c14/Connectedness%200af0cd197c794a52835c8791741ad832.md), [Relator](../../Learn%2003d2ad3fc6464b7e9daa164af77e7688/Human%2004c79c94438c46a99ae6f6fa1ec90829/Tools%205f0f404d05e94839b61e75e53d392983/CliftonStrengths%2025f5a900977a48ffa837ad3fa1238340/Themes%209c16e613023743ae9f91a5ec8165a876/Relationship%20Building%200ed193b271f946ef92bc13c3ee390c14/Relator%203a3413ce38ae4f0dad5ce379b18c294e.md), [Learner](../../Learn%2003d2ad3fc6464b7e9daa164af77e7688/Human%2004c79c94438c46a99ae6f6fa1ec90829/Tools%205f0f404d05e94839b61e75e53d392983/CliftonStrengths%2025f5a900977a48ffa837ad3fa1238340/Themes%209c16e613023743ae9f91a5ec8165a876/Strategic%20Thinking%20464a4c7f923b4d2f98dbc63e821e847c/Learner%202496e9863958483d97e373f553d51f0d.md), [Responsibility](../../Learn%2003d2ad3fc6464b7e9daa164af77e7688/Human%2004c79c94438c46a99ae6f6fa1ec90829/Tools%205f0f404d05e94839b61e75e53d392983/CliftonStrengths%2025f5a900977a48ffa837ad3fa1238340/Themes%209c16e613023743ae9f91a5ec8165a876/Executing%20001f4521e469482d8ee98715cec37a5e/Responsibility%200869433bc810441eadc6da6471fd473a.md). At first glance, I was surprised by how accurate these findings seemed. As I began reflecting on my past experiences and approach to work, I realized these strengths resonated with me and shed light on some of my most defining traits.
For instance, I've always had a workaholic attitude and a solid drive to progress in my career and personal goals, even during my vacations. This aligns perfectly with the Achiever's strength. Another example is my deep-rooted disdain for those who lack integrity at work, which corresponds with Responsibility strength.

Furthermore, I've always valued my one-on-one sessions with team members, rarely skipping them throughout my career as a lead or engineering manager. This can be attributed to my Relator strength. Additionally, I've consistently sought out companies that I believe have a significant social impact or cause, demonstrating my Connectedness strength.
Finally, a colleague once told me, "I think learning is your hobby." This statement reflects my Learner strength and the constant pursuit of knowledge and self-improvement.

Not only has the CliftonStrengths assessment helped me understand my innate tendencies and behaviors, but it has also provided me with a sense of validation. Embracing my unique strengths has empowered me to become a more effective leader and foster an environment where my team and I can thrive. I now feel confident that choosing a career as a software engineering manager was the right path for me.

In conclusion, my initial skepticism about the CliftonStrengths assessment has transformed into gratitude and self-awareness. I can now better leverage my strengths, which have positively impacted my career and personal growth. I recommend this assessment to anyone looking for deeper insight into their strengths and how they can use them to achieve success in their chosen field.
