A few months ago, I stumbled upon ChatGPT; honestly, I wasn't very interested initially. It seemed like a toy, but everything changed when I learned that the API was accessible to developers. I began using ChatGPT for exploration before diving deep into specific topics, and that's when I discovered its true potential.

However, ChatGPT does have its limitations, primarily when it comes to up-to-date information. It's not ideal for seeking current factual details. For instance, I will not ask ChatGPT 3.5 for Google's headquarters address as of 30th April 2023.

So, what are the actual use cases for ChatGPT? Here's how it's been helpful to me:

1. **Quickly exploring and iterating ideas**: My professor once said that asking good questions is one of the most crucial life skills. I rapidly iterate on the topic I am interested in, providing insights that lead me to more profound research using trusted sources like books, papers, and other resources.
2. **Writing assistance**: ChatGPT is excellent for drafting content. I provide bullet points, proofread the output, add my personal touch, and process it through Grammarly for English. I can even modify the questions to generate content in languages like Bahasa. While some might argue this is duplication, the most critical aspect is the idea itself, and people can discern whether an article is original.
3. **Enhancing my Logseq experience**: ChatGPT has been invaluable for feeding data into my Logseq and making my graph explode (in a good way!). It's now one of the primary weapons in my creative arsenal.

So, why invest in ChatGPT Plus instead of using the free version? For me, access to GPT-4 is a game-changer. Although it's limited to 25 questions per 3 hours (as of April 2023), it provides more precise and better answers (I rarely hit the limit anyway). I use it often, and the time it saves me is worth the subscription cost.

In conclusion, give the free version of ChatGPT a try. If you find it helpful and need a more robust model, investing in ChatGPT Plus is worth it. Happy creating!
