# CliftonStrengths

## Introduction

CliftonStrengths is a personal development tool created by the Gallup organization based on the idea that focusing on your natural talents and strengths can lead to more tremendous personal and professional success. The CliftonStrengths assessment helps individuals identify and better understand their unique talents and abilities based on 34 different themes.

When a person takes the CliftonStrengths assessment, they receive a personalized report listing their top five strengths and a complete ranking of all 34 themes. The review is designed to help individuals identify what comes naturally to them and where they are most likely to excel.

According to the CliftonStrengths philosophy, individuals who focus on developing their strengths rather than improving their weaknesses are more likely to achieve success and satisfaction. By building on their natural talents, individuals can become more confident and effective in their work and personal lives.

The 34 themes measured by the CliftonStrengths assessment include adaptability, empathy, ideation, and strategic thinking. Each theme is designed to capture a specific aspect of personality and behavior that contributes to success in different arenas.

Overall, the CliftonStrengths assessment and philosophy are intended to help individuals identify their natural talents and focus on developing them into strengths. By doing so, individuals can achieve tremendous success and satisfaction in their lives and careers.
