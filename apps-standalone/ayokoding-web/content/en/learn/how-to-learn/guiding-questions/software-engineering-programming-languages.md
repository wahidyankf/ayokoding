# Software Engineering - Programming Languages

## Theoretical Approach

### Language Basics

1. What is the syntax for declaring variables?

2. How are data types handled (static vs. dynamic typing)?

3. What are the primary control structures (if/else, loops, etc.)?

4. How is memory management handled?

5. What is the scope of variables?

### Object-Oriented Programming

6. Does the language support OOP concepts?

7. How is inheritance implemented?

8. What is the syntax for defining classes and objects?

9. How does the language handle polymorphism?

10. Are there access modifiers for encapsulation?

### Functional Programming

11. Does the language support functional programming paradigms?

12. How are higher-order functions implemented?

13. Is there support for lambda functions or closures?

14. How does the language handle immutability?

### Error Handling

15. What mechanisms are available for error handling?

16. How are exceptions thrown and caught?

17. Are there built-in error types?

### Concurrency and Parallelism

18. How does the language handle multithreading?

19. Are there built-in constructs for asynchronous programming?

20. What synchronization mechanisms are available?

### Standard Library and Ecosystem

21. What core libraries are included?

22. How extensive is the standard library?

23. What package management system is used?

24. How active is the developer community?

### Performance and Optimization

25. Is the language compiled or interpreted?

26. What optimizations does the language or its compiler provide?

27. How does garbage collection work (if applicable)?

### Unique Features

28. What are some unique features or syntax elements of this language?

29. How does it differ from other popular programming languages?

30. What specific problems or domains is this language designed to address?
