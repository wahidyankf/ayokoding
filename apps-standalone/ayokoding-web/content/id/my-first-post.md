# Welcome to My First Post

This is a test post to verify that Hugo is working correctly. Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go, and is designed to make website creation fun again.

## Features of Hugo

1. Blazing fast build times
2. Robust content management
3. Flexible templating
4. Built-in development server

## Code Example

Here's a simple code example:

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Hugo!")
}
```

## Mermaid Diagram Example

Here's a sample Mermaid diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Hugo
    participant Browser
    User->>Hugo: Create content
    Hugo->>Browser: Generate static site
    Browser-->>User: Display content
    loop LiveReload
        Hugo->>Browser: Update changes
    end
    Note right of Hugo: Fast and efficient!
```

Feel free to modify this post or add more content to test different Hugo features!
