## Add meta

for every markdown file, need to add meta in the beginning of the file. such as:

```
title: 'Title'
date: 2024-10-20T14:48:02+07:00
draft: false
```

with:

- date is current date-time
- draft is always false
- title is the title of the file (you can it in the H1 in the content of the file)

## \_index.md will list all file and folders
