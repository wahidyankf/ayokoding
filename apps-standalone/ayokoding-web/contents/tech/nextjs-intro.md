# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and more.

## Key Features

1. **App Router**: Simplified routing with file-system based routing
2. **Server Components**: Render components on the server for better performance
3. **Static Site Generation**: Pre-render pages at build time

```typescript
// Example of a simple Next.js page
export default function HomePage() {
  return <h1>Welcome to Next.js!</h1>
}
```

Happy coding!
